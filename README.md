# Twig

Twig is a project management application created for both the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. The application aims to support agile project management with three distinct features: a kanban board, data visualisations and capture verification. These features are designed to assist collaborative and individual activity and can be applicable across a range of industries. Twig employs three different technologies, Flutter,  Dart and Firebase to create a natively compiled cross-platform mobile application. The UI is developed in Dart using Flutter frameworks and the backend database is provided in real time by Firebase.
